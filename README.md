# Introduction

The aim of this wee document is to try and collect together links to as many
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)-based applications and third-party
tools as possible.

While I do work for [Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/), and am one of
the Textual developers, this is a personal project, done for fun, out of
curiosity, and to help the wider Textual community.

If you have something you think should be on this list, let me know and I'll
add it. Or PR to it I guess. It's cool either way.
